This is a Native React chat app that will allow users to join a chat with their own username and background color, send normal text as well as images and location data, with offline and online data storage.

This app requires React, React-native, Expo, and Firebase. 

In order to test, run npm install to install all project dependencies from package.json, and then "npx expo start -c" to run with a clean cache.
